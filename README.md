# Relative-Humidity-Elevation-Tables
These are RH elevation tables for use with a psychrometer to take and track local weather patterns. 
I took the information from https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/pms437/weather/temp-rh-dp-tables and manually entered it into csv format.


How to use this table:


The top row of numbers moving right on the X axis are your wet bulb values. The Y numbers moving down on the left are your dry bulb values.
Take your wet and dry values and find the intersecting rh.

ex: using RH table 0-500ft
wet 23
dry 31
RH = 18
