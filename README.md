# Relative-Humidity-Elevation-Tables
These are RH elevation tables for use with a psychrometer to take and track local weather patterns. Information taken from NWCG (nwcg.gov) website and manually entered into csv format by me.


How to use this table.


The top row of numbers moving right on the x axis are your wet bulb values. the y numbers moving down on the left are your dry bulb values.
The table is simple, take your wet and dry numbers and find the intersecting rh.

ex: using RH table 0-500ft
wet 23
dry 31
RH = 18
